# Kickstarter-analysis
##Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover outcomes. #Kickstarting with Excel
## Analysis
This analysis goal is to utilize beginner skills needed for an analyst. To complete the Kickstarter analaysis, with the data provided my task required me to uncover Louise's theater/play fiancial goal. I was able to categorize different sets of the data to create Excel Pivot tables and Charts. I used different functions within excell to  acquire the disered outcomes.
The graphs below show the outcomes based on both Launch Date and Goals give us an insight on a few things. Louise recived No canceled plays. The end of the year seemed to be low so I would not recommend having a fundraiser aound November and December. Howerver May is the perfect month to do so. i beleive her overall sucessful plays based on the charts created are good for Louise's campaign.

## Challenges 
The data set was not too much to work through, in my opinion the initial data could have been a smaller size. Working with the different fumction in excell was also a challenge. I i was to use to Help throught the modulele to make things easier to understand. Working with github and ssh krys was also a challenge i encountered throughout this module. My Tutor was very helpful and inforative.
